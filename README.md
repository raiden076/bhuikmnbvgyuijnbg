We will need the following files:

1. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the Python package dependencies that are needed to run the project.

2. `universities.py`: This file will contain the list of universities and departments.

3. `google_search.py`: This file will contain the function to perform a Google search using the Google Search API.

4. `pdf_crawler.py`: This file will contain the Scrapy spider that will crawl the base-domains and collect all the PDF links.

5. `main.py`: This is the entrypoint file that will use the functions from the other files to perform the tasks.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file:
